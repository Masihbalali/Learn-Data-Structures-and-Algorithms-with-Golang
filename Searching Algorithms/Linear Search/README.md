Linear Search 

### Introduction
1. Its Simplest algorithm for searching
2. We just iterate throw the array and try to find the value we want
3. It has time notation of O(n)

### Steps to make a Linear Search
1. Start from one side and iterate throw the array
2. Compare the values to the value we want and return it if find it
3. Do this until we checked all the elements in the array 
4. If it was not in the array after checking all the elements that means there is no value like we want in that array


### Pros 
1. Its simple
2. Good for small datasets
3. It doesn't need memory because its in-place
4. We can use it for unsorted or unordered arrays

### Cons
1. Slow for large datasets because of time complexity of O(n)
